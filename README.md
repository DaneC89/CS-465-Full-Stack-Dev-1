# CS-465-Full-Stack-Dev-1

Architecture:

In my full stack project, I utilized various technologies for frontend and backend development, including Express for handling server-side logic, HTML for structuring the content, and JavaScript for client-side scripting. Additionally, I incorporated a single-page application (SPA) approach using a frontend framework like Angular.
Comparing Express HTML, JavaScript, and the SPA approach:

  1.	Express HTML: Express is a backend framework for Node.js that facilitates server-side routing and handling requests. HTML is used to structure the content and define        the layout of web pages. In this approach, the frontend and backend are more tightly integrated, with the server rendering HTML templates and delivering them to the         client.
     
  2.	JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language used for client-side scripting. It enables dynamic interactions on the webpage, such as validating forms, animating         elements, and making asynchronous requests to the backend. It enhances user experience but requires careful management to prevent performance issues.
     
  3.	Single-Page Application (SPA): SPAs use JavaScript frameworks to dynamically load content and update the page without requiring full page reloads. This enhances speed       and responsiveness, as only the necessary data is fetched from the server. This approach separates frontend and backend more distinctly, allowing the frontend to            communicate with the backend through APIs.
     
NoSQL MongoDB Database:

The backend might have chosen a NoSQL MongoDB database for several reasons:

  1.	Flexibility: NoSQL databases like MongoDB are schema-less, allowing for dynamic and flexible data structures. This can be advantageous when dealing with varying data        formats in a full stack project.
     
  2.	Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, making it suitable for applications that may experience rapid growth in data volume and user base.
   
  3.	Complex Data: If the project involves complex and hierarchical data structures, MongoDB's document-oriented approach can simplify data storage and retrieval.
   
  4.	Agile Development: MongoDB's flexibility aligns well with agile development practices, allowing developers to quickly adapt to changing requirements.
    Functionality:

JSON vs. JavaScript: 

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. It is inspired by JavaScript object literals but is distinct from JavaScript itself. JSON provides a standardized way to represent data as text, making it easy to transmit data between a frontend and backend, even if they're built using different programming languages.

Refactoring and Reusable UI Components: 

During the full stack development process, there were instances where I refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency. For example, I might have optimized database queries, modularized code for better maintainability, and implemented caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data. By creating reusable UI components, I could ensure consistency in the user interface, reduce redundancy in code, and accelerate development by applying the same components across different parts of the application.

Testing:
Methods, Endpoints, and Security:

  •	Methods: In a full stack application, methods refer to the types of operations that can be performed on the server. Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST         (create data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).
  •	Endpoints: Endpoints are specific URLs on the server that correspond to different methods and resources. They define the routes that the frontend can use to interact        with the backend.
  •	Security: Security involves protecting the application from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities. This includes implementing authentication and     authorization mechanisms, securing data transmission with encryption (HTTPS), and safeguarding against common web security threats.
  
API Testing and Security Difficulties:

API testing involves verifying that the API endpoints function as expected. This includes testing different methods, handling edge cases, and validating responses. However, API testing can become challenging when security layers like authentication and authorization are added. Testing these layers might require mocking authentication tokens or simulating different user roles to ensure that access is restricted appropriately.

Reflection:

My professional goal is to become a software engineer. I think a big part of this will be knowing how backend and frontend software is developed. Learning more about how the server side communicates with the client side is important in understanding how to create secure programs. Additionally, adding a new coding language in HTML is something that will help me to stand out in job hunt. The biggest takeaway for me has been learning and using SPAs. With the use of SPAs, I will be able to create more functional and responsive websites. This is something that I believe will be sought after in my future career. Overall, I believe I have a good foundation in Full Stack development that I can build on. With more practice im sure I will become much more proficient. 

In summary, my understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application involves creating routes (endpoints) that correspond to specific operations (methods) and ensuring that these interactions are secure through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
